# autoluigi
A terrible bot for *Super Smash Bros. Melee* that aims to play Luigi as uselessly as possible.

## Tactics
Currently, it wavedashes at you and gets stuck sometimes.

## Known bugs
Many.

## Usage
Don't. Though if you must, install libmelee (`pip install melee`) then run `bot.py`. It will not work because it's Windows-specific and more importantly, specific to my computer and user account. Have fun.

## Using it online
I don't care, it's so bad it's gonna make you lose every game anyway.
